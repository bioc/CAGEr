# Changes in devel version

BUG FIXES

-   Fix accidental deletion of the record of the  _tag clustering_ method (#96).

NEW FEATURES

-   New `resetCAGEexp()` function.
-   New `flagByUpstreamSequences()` function.
-   The `annotateCTSS` and `annotateConsensusClusters` function gain a
    `upstream` and a `downstream` parameter to change the width of promoter
    regions.

# Changes in version 2.7.1

BUG FIXES

-   Correct quantile positions, which were shifted by one base.  This bug may
    have been introduced in version 1.22 or later.
-   Ensure cluster objects are properly sorted.  Fixes #79, introduced in
    version 2.6.0 and causing crashes or incorrect quantile calculations.
-   Apply fix for #77 (aggregateTagClusters losing TCs), which slipped out of
    2.6.0 because of Git branch mixup.
-   Fix _consensus cluster_ coordinates, where the `maxDist` padding was
    erroneously remaining in some parts of the computation.
-   Corrected on-the-fly cumulative sum computation for consensus clusters when
    `sample = NULL`.  The bug was causing incorrectly short quantile ranges.
-   Force the cluster names to stay sorted, to avoid a bug desynchronising
    quantile information and genome coordinates.
    
NEW FEATURES

-   Allow URLs to files in `getCTSS()` (Fixes #50).
-   Accelerated the computation of quantile position by ~20 times.

# Changes in version 2.6.0

BUG FIXES

-   Re-enable the promoter shift functions (Fixes #4).
-   Compute dominant TSS information for *consensus clusters* (Fixes
    #1).

NEW FEATURES

-   Inter-quantile width is also computed when no sample is selected.
-   Enhancer detection using a wrapper to the _CAGEfighter_ package's
    function `quickEnhancers()`.

# No changes in version 2.4.0 (2/11/2022)

# Changes in version 2.2.0 (27/4/2022)

BUG FIXES

-   Restore the `correctSystematicG` option in `getCTSS()`. See #61.
-   Restore object class consistency in if / else statement in private
    function `bam2CTSS`. Fixes #49.
-   Restore proper CTSS conversion from BAM files (bug introduced in
    v1.34.0) while fixing issue #36.
-   Ensure Tag Clusters have a Seqinfo. Fixes #63.

# Changes in version 2.0.0 (27/10/2021)

BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

-   The `CAGEset` class is removed.
-   Accessors using plain `data.frame` formats are removed.
-   Modifier functions return the object instead of silently modifying
    it in the global environment. Thus, you can use R pipes (`|>`).
-   Removed export function that unconditionally wrote files to the
    working directory, such as `exportCTSStoBedGraph`. As a replacement
    a new converter is provided, `exportToBrowserTrack`, that produces
    `UCSCData` objects that the user can then wite to files using the
    rtracklayer\_ package.
-   Removed the `extractExpressionClass` function, as the information is
    easily accessible from within the `CTSS` or `ConsensusClusters`
    objects.

NEW FEATURES

-   `CTSSnormalizedTpmGR` and `CTSStagCountGR` now accept `all` as a
    special sample name to return them all in a `GRangesList` object.
-   Plot interquantile width and expression clusters with *ggplot2*.

BUG FIXES

-   Corrected the `getExpressionProfiles` function to accept *CAGEexp*
    objects.
-   Updated the `exampleCAGEexp` object to contain expression classes.
-   Restore paraclu support for *CAGEexp* objects.
-   Corrected a bug in `aggregateTagClusters` that was causing
    mislabelling of tag clusters (PR#42).
-   Prevent `plotReverseCumulatives` from crashing when values are not
    in range. (PR#43).

# Changes in version 1.34.0 (20/5/2021)

BUG FIXES

-   Reform the *CTSS* class. New accessor: `CTSS()` (with no dot).
-   Correct a class error when loading BAM files. (Closes #36).
-   Use the *BSgenome* object from the main environment if available.

# Changes in version 1.32.0 (28/10/2020)

BUG FIXES

-   Update end coordinates before start coordinates in the function
    `.aggregateTagClustersGR()`. This should stop triggering
    *\"'width(x)' cannot contain negative integers\"* errors.
-   Correct `.make.consensus.clusters` internal function. This should
    stop triggering *\"Consensus clusters must not overlap with each
    other\"* errors.
-   Allow empty `CTSS.chr` objects.
-   Correct `plotInterquantileWidth()` to really use consensus clusters
    when passed the argument `clusters = "consensusClusters"`.
-   Fix failures on *CAGEexp* objects containing only one sample.

# Changes in version 1.30.0 (28/5/2020)

BUG FIXES

-   Correct usage of `&&` for vector comparison in pairs.DataFrame().
-   Adjust to latest *SummarizedExperiment* *MultiAssayExperiment*
    versions.

# Changes in version 1.28.0 (30/10/2019)

BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

-   The *CTSS* objects are now based on the *UnstitchedGPos* class
    instead of the parent *GPos* class. Existing *CAGEexp* objects might
    give errors after package upgrade.

NEW FEATURES

-   Depends on *MultiAssayExperiment* instead of previously importing
    it. No need to load it by hand (nor *SummaryExperiment*) anymore.

BUG FIXES

-   Correct strand in `.remove.added.G` private function (PR#26).

# Changes in version 1.26.0 (3/5/2019)

DOCUMENTATION

-   Split the \"*CAGE resources*\" documentation into a separate
    vignette.

# Changes in version 1.24.0 (31/10/2018)

NEW FEATURES

-   `plotAnnot()`: the `group` argument now accepts formulas such as
    `~ a + b` to indicate names of metadata column that will be pasted
    together to form a new group factor.

BUG FIXES

-   Prevent `mergeSamples()` from producing `colData` that cause other
    functions to crash later when coercing to *data.frame*.
-   Repaired paraclu support for *CAGEset* objects.
-   `normalizeTagCount()` works again on *CAGEset* objects.
-   `consensusClustersGR()` reports expression score of the selected
    sample (instead of silently ignoring the `sample` argument and
    reporting expression sum on all the samples).

# Changes in version 1.22.0 (1/5/2018)

BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

-   The plotting functions send their output to the graphical device
    instead of writing it to a file. This makes their use more
    consistent with most plotting functions in R.

NEW FEATURES

-   New *CAGEexp* class extending the *MultiAssayExperiment* class. It
    stores expression data more efficiently than *CAGEset*, and uses
    core Bioconductor types natively. For backwards compatibility it
    also support many of the original generic functions for *CAGEset*
    objects. Sample names in *CAGEexp* objects must by syntactically
    valid. Some methods are not yet available for *CAGEexp* object (see
    the vignette). Conversely some new functions will not be available
    for *CAGEset* objects.
-   New *CTSS* and *TagClusters* classes wrapping *GPos* and *GRanges*
    objects, for more type safety.
-   New functions for quality controls such as `plotAnnot()` or
    `hanabiPlot()`. See the *CAGEexp* vignette for details.
-   New `removeStrandInvaders()` function to count and remove
    strand-invasion artefacts (see Tang et al., 2013,
    <doi:10.1093/nar/gks112>).
-   Data export as *DESeqDataSet* object for *DESeq2* with the new
    `consensusClustersDESeq2()` and `GeneExpDESeq2()` functions.
-   New `bedctss` format to load the FANTOM5 and FANTOM6 CAGE data.
-   Multicore parallelisation with *BiocParallel* instead of *parallel*.
-   New function `sampleList()` to help looping on samples with
    `lapply()`.
-   New `plotCorrelation2()` function, faster than `plotCorrelation()`
    because it is plain black and white.
-   Multicore loading of CTSS data in *CAGEexp* objects.

OTHER CHANGES

-   Example data `exampleCAGEexp`, `exampleCAGEexp` and
    `exampleZv9_annot` are now is lazy-loaded.
-   `NULL` can be passed as genome name, to circumvent the requirement
    for a *BSgenome* object when actually not needing one.
-   In *CAGEexp* objects, expression quantile positions are given
    relative to the cluster start site.
-   For performance reasons, the positions of a quantile Q is now
    calculated as the position of the first base where cumulative
    expression is higher or equal to Q% of the total expression of a
    cluster.
-   `plotReverseCumulatives()`:
    -   fitInRange accepts a value of `NULL` to turn off power law
        fitting.
    -   New `legend` argument to remove legend when set to `FALSE`.
    -   Axis range and labels can be modified with xlab/ylab and
        xlim/ylim.
    -   Ladders steps start on the values instead of being centered on.
-   `setColors()`: allow lowercase in color names.

BUG FIXES

-   Corrected a bug that was crashing *CAGEset* objects when loading
    more than one BAM file.
-   Load BAM as gapped alignment with `readGAlignments()` instead of
    `scanBam()`. Without this correction, TSS position on minus strand
    is incorrect in case of indels in the read.

DOCUMENTATION UPDATES

-   Roxygen is used to generate the manual pages.
-   A new HTML vignette describes the *CAGEexp* class.

# Changes in version 1.18.1

    extracting sample-specific information, such as CAGE signal,
    position of the dominant TSS and interquantile width in a specific
    sample (i.e. `consensusClusters()` now behaves analogously to
    `tagClusters()` function).
-   10/03/2016 fixed the bandwidth of the smoothing kernel for plotting
    correlation density plots to always scale with the number of bins.
-   10/03/2016 added new argument to `plotCorrelation()` function that
    allows controlling figure size in pixels.

    clusters, which contained overlapping blocks per record and caused
    problems when trying to convert bed to bigBed.
-   03/11/2015 added an option of exporting CTSS bedGraph files to
    BigWig format - added a new argument to `exportCTSStoBedGraph()`

    as a dataset that can be loaded via call to
    .`data(FANTOM5humanSamples)` or `data(FANTOM5mouseSamples)`.
-   25/05/2014 modified the `importPublicData()` function so that it
    supports importing FANTOM5 data for human and mouse directly from
    FANTOM web resource, as well as data from several CAGE data
    packages.
-   23/05/2014 optimized the creation of CTSS table across samples by

-   08/08/2013 added new argument to `aggregateTagClusters()` function
    (`excludeSignalBelowThreshold`) that controls which TCs will
    contribute to the total CAGE signal of the consensus cluster - only
    the ones above the threshold that are used initially to set the
    boundaries of the consensus cluster, or all TCs that overlap the
    resulting consensus clusters.

# Changes in version 1.2.1 (28/05/2013)

-   28/05/2013 fixed the bug in reporting number of CTSSs in cluster
    when clustering CTSSs using custom clusters (for empty clusters it
    was returning that the number of CTSSs is 1, although the signal is
    0)  
-   28/05/2013 fixed the bug in clustering CTSSs using custom clusters
    when run with `multicore=FALSE` (it was returning to many clusters -
    correct specified region but all of the regions on each chromosome,
    not only the specified one).
-   22/05/2013 fixed the column classes in CTSS data.frame when reading
    the data from bam files (to match the classes when reading from ctss
    files).
-   21/05/2013 updated the vignette with explanation on how to use
    custom build genomes.
-   21/05/2013 allowed usage of custom build *BSgenome* packages by

# Changes in version 1.2.0 (02/05/2013)

-   02/05/2013 updated the vignette.
-   02/05/2013 added a new feature in the `plotReverseCumulatives`
    function, so that the slope of the fitted power-law distribution in
    the user selected range of values is shown on the plot for each
    sample (helps to choose appropriate alpha parameter for
    normalization).
-   02/05/2013 fixed a bug in selecting the range of tag count values
    for fitting power-law distribution in normalization.
-   01/05/2013 added sample labels as names to library sizes vector.

    for differential promoter usage based on cumulative sums of CAGE
    signal along the promoters (implemented within the `scoreShift`
    function).
-   20/04/2013 added pass-through option `none` for `method` parameter
    in `normalizeTagCount` function to enable using raw tag counts in
    downstream steps (CTSS clustering, promoter width, etc.).
-   19/04/2013 optimized `scoreShift` function to extract and process
    only the cumulative sums for samples being compared.
-   19/04/2013 replaced lapply with a for loop in the `scoreShift`
    function to avoid invoking `multicore` within `lapply`.

    function that notifies about accepted values for `what` parameter.
-   27/03/2013 added *data.table* to the list of dependencies and
    optimized various parts of the code to use *data.table* instead of
    *data.frame*.
